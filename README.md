# UIT-Courseplanner
## Information
This is the project repository for a group project that I worked on during my 3rd semester at UiT
The project aims to simplify course planning and sheduling for the school, and have the ability to create standardized documents from a user friendly interface, instead of manually creating the course plans. 

### Disruption
There could be errors in the code or version incompatability, the code has not been checked in a long while but it should run on php version 7.4.

## Content
The webpage is built in to three parts, course coordination, course creation, and course management.
Therefore, the application consists of a course creating feature that is linked to the users.
A management portal for the Decan or institute leaders, that allows them to verify the courses.

A course management feature that gives the user the ability to copy previous plans, or sub events of a previous plan, and allow them to set a duration.

There are also built in features for giving other users access to preview and edit, or make comments on the plans.
Additionally there is also functionallity to export the plans to print, in a format that normal course plans are made, to *Word Documents, or PDF.*
